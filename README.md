# Synth-Gen
Synth-Gen is an innovative synthetic data generator designed to address the inherent challenges in financial data analysis. By leveraging Coalsent Theory, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and BERT embeddings, Synth-Gen aims to create a diverse and high-quality synthetic dataset for more effective predictive modeling in finance.

Problem Statement
The field of financial data analysis faces critical challenges:

Inadequate Quality and Scope:

Existing financial datasets often lack the required breadth and depth, limiting their effectiveness in predictive modeling.
Data Integrity Concerns:

There is a significant worry about the accuracy and reliability of financial data, restricting the development of robust predictive models.
Project Objectives
Synth-Gen addresses these challenges by:

Creating Diverse and Broad Datasets:

Synth-Gen generates synthetic data with a broader scope, providing a more diverse dataset for comprehensive predictive modeling.
Ensuring Data Integrity:

By incorporating Coalsent Theory, Synth-Gen enhances the integrity of synthetic data, capturing the true dynamics of financial environments.
