## Problem Definition
In the realm of financial data analysis, challenges such as inadequate data quality, limited scope, and inherent biases severely restrict the development of robust predictive models. Our project addresses these issues by generating synthetic financial data that offers a wider scope and greater diversity, thus enhancing predictive modeling capabilities and ensuring a higher degree of data integrity.

## Motivation
This project is driven by the urgent need to overcome the limitations of current financial datasets. With synthetic data that is representative of real-world financial scenarios, we aim to provide a solution to the scarcity and biases present in existing datasets. This will facilitate more accurate and effective financial analysis and modeling.

## Scope of Project
Our approach applies coalescent theory, an evolutionary biology concept, to the financial domain for synthetic data generation. We are integrating evolutionary algorithms and deep learning models to simulate natural genetic variation and adaptation within financial contexts. The goal is to produce synthetic data that mirrors the complexity of real-world financial markets.

## Salient Contribution
- **Diverse and Representative Datasets:** Overcoming the limitations of traditional financial data by generating a rich variety of synthetic datasets.
- **Enhanced Data Quality and Integrity:** Providing unbiased, high-integrity datasets for more accurate financial analysis.
- **Innovative Cross-Disciplinary Methodology:** Blending concepts from biology, deep learning, and finance to pioneer synthetic data generation techniques.
- **Resource Enrichment for Financial Analysis:** Offering datasets that closely resemble authentic financial data, thus significantly enhancing analytical resources.
